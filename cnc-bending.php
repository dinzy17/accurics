                    <p class="mt-3">
                      Computer Numerical Control (CNC) bending machines are refined tube benders that
                      guarantee a high level of productivity and repeatability. These machines fabricate high
                      environment bent tubes that can be used for various classified ad applications employed
                      in the automotive, chemical, and furniture industries, as ably as for ship building,
                      railways, and new same industries. It is a highly automated and efficient in terms of
                      precise bending. It allows high dimensional accuracy and design flexibility.

                    Our Expert team of <b>CNC Laser cutting</b> operators and program always take care of
                    quality and material, We have high productivity results with table speed of 1.3 times and
                    back gauge speed 3 times. However, we use up to date softwareâ€™s with easy
                    programming, direct angle mode, new Bend deduction calculation, and note functions.
                    Our <b>CNC bending</b> machine has wider functions in terms of height tool, supporter, etc. It
                    also stimulates the bending process detecting collusion. This results in lower wastage
                    and in turn economic manufacturing at faster speed resulting in quick deliveries.

                    Our manufacturing plants have capacity of room 160 Tons and Ram length of 3 meter.
                    We can offer Bending up to 10 mm thickness for sheet steel. The knowledge and
                    experience of bending operators that helps guarantee part accuracy and efficiency,
                    knowing this well we provide the training necessary to give that expertise to the operators
                    in the first place and time to time we organize training sessions within workshop to update
                    the operators about new techniques and tools to improve productivity.
